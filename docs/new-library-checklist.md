# Checklist for adding a new library/package

Before you decide to add a new library in this project you need to make sure you have checked few things.

- [ ] Check the library size from [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/)
- [ ] Check the library github repo and see if it gets regular updates
- [ ] Check the library github repo issue section and see if they are properly addressed
- [ ] Check if the library is typescript supported
- [ ] Share the library in the group chat to receive opinions & feedbacks from others

NB: A library might not tick all the checkbox here but if it's really good feel free to share it on the group channel and discuss.
